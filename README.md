# State Machines
The problem: Using multiple booleans to represent states and enforce business rules.
State Machine: Mathematical model of computation, with a finite number of states, transition between states, and a mathine that can only be at a state at a given time. 
Design a state machine: 
  1. Define a finite number of states.
  2. Lay down the transitions between states what are the business rules what we want to enforce.
  3. Select the initial state.
